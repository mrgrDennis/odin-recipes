    <p>In most parts of Africa, cornmeal, is a side dish you would find in restaurant menus and in home kitchens around the continent – under different aliases. The most notable are fufu corn (West Africa) couscous de maize (French-speaking African Countries) Ugali (Kenya) Nshima – Zambia, Nsima – Malawi, and South Africa – Meilie pap.</p>
    
    <h2>ingredients</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>4 cup water, or more</li>
        <li>2 cup fine corn meal</li>
        <li>½ -1 teaspoon salt</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Add about 4 cups of water to a large heavy-bottomed saucepan. Add ½ teaspoon of salt. Bring to a boil, remove about a cup of water and set aside.</li>
        <li>Gradually whisk in the cornmeal until you have added the whole thing to the pot, a little bit at a time, and keep stirring with a wooden spoon to prevent lumps. You may have to take the saucepan off the heat while getting rid of lumps and preventing burns.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to low and cook until the mixture thickens.</li>
        <li>Then add the remaining boiled water, reduce heat, cover, and cook for about 10 or more. You may add some more water if desired. Turn off the heat.</li>
        <li>Scoop out balls with a small bowl – shake and form a ball by rolling around a bowl. Or place it on a saran wrap</li>
    </ol>
